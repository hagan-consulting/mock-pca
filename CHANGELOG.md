# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file. The format is based on
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.2] - 2026-11-13

### Changed
- Go 1.27.4 (`go.mod` and the container build image).
- Container image: the Debian trixie-slim runtime base image is updated to its current digest.
- `Dockerfile`: the base-image pin comments no longer name a date or repo-info commit, so Dependabot digest updates
  do not leave them stale.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-11-04

### Changed
- Container images are published from CI after its checks pass: `edge` and `sha-<commit>` on every push to `main`,
  `X.Y.Z`, `X.Y`, `latest` and `sha-<commit>` on release tags, with BuildKit provenance and an SBOM in addition to the
  signed build provenance attestation. The per-architecture `X.Y.Z-amd64` and `X.Y.Z-arm64` tags are no longer
  published.
- CI applies an image retention policy to GHCR after every publish (`tools/ghcr-prune`): release images, `latest` and
  `edge` kept, `sha-*`-only images deleted after 14 days, unneeded untagged manifests at once.
- CI builds and smoke-tests the container image on linux/arm64 as well as linux/amd64 for every pull request.

### Fixed
- Release workflow: the build provenance attestation is now pushed to the registry. The publish job logged out of
  ghcr.io before the attest step, which reads the registry login from the Docker configuration, so the 0.1.0 image
  was published without an attestation.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-11-04

First public release.

### Added
- `bin/mockpca`: OpenSSL-based mock PCA: `init` (PCA root), `ica` (Tier-2/Tier-n ICAs, re-key with `--renew`),
  `issue` and `sign-csr` (Agency, Agent, Element, Service, Signing certificates per CP v1.3 with the Quad ID),
  `revoke`, `crl`, `verify`, `list`, `lint`, `serve`. It enforces the CP by default: every issued certificate must
  pass `mockpca-lint` (a failing one is revoked and moved to `rejected/`); only ICAs issue End-Entity certificates;
  no issuance below a revoked CA; unique subject DNs and Quad IDs (`--renew` for renewal and re-key); `sign-csr`
  checks the CSR's key (CP 6.1.6); the iD is the first dNSName; subjects in CP table order; NIOC Agency Certificates
  may be owned by the PCA's iD; no `certificateHold`; warnings for CRL lifetimes and republishing intervals over
  24 hours.
- `mockpca-lint`: checks certificates against the NG9-1-1 PKI CP v1.3 profiles (PCA, ICA, Agency, Agent, Element,
  Service, Signing): names, string types and attribute order, ICA tier and OU serial numbers, key sizes and RSA
  exponent, key usage and extKeyUsage, validity, every §7.1.2 extension, the Quad ID, and (given the issuer)
  signature, AKI, nesting and End-Entities issued by the PCA; `-root` accepts NIOC Agency Certificates.
- `mockpca-serve`: HTTP publication of CA certificates and CRLs at the URLs in the certificates, revalidated by a
  content ETag.
- OCSP responders for every mock CA (#1): `mockpca-serve -pki` answers GET and POST at `/ocsp/<ca>` (SHA-1 and
  SHA-256 CertIDs, responses signed by OpenSSL per request; strict GET decoding per RFC 9919 6; caching headers per
  RFC 9919 6 and 7.2 taken from the signed response, with a SHA-256 ETag); delegated responder certificates issued
  with every CA (`ocsp-responder` profile, also in `mockpca-lint`) or CA-signed responses (`mockpca ocsp-signer`);
  fault injection per CA (`mockpca ocsp-fault`, including a responder certificate without `id-pkix-ocsp-nocheck` as a
  negative fixture); stapling files (`mockpca ocsp-response`); `mockpca serve` checks responder certificates at least
  daily.
- Container image (`Dockerfile`, Debian trixie-slim with OpenSSL 3, prebuilt Go tools, non-root user, PKI in
  `/pki`), `compose.yaml` serving the PKI as `pca.mock.test`, the `scripts/container-test.sh` smoke test in CI, and
  `MOCKPCA_SERVE` to use a prebuilt `mockpca-serve` (like `MOCKPCA_LINT`).
- Release workflow (`.github/workflows/release-image.yml`): on a `vX.Y.Z` tag on `main` with a matching CHANGELOG
  section, builds the container image natively for linux/amd64 and linux/arm64, smoke-tests each build, publishes
  `ghcr.io/hagan-consulting/mock-pca` (`X.Y.Z`, `X.Y`, `latest`) and attests its build provenance.
- `examples/demo.sh` sample hierarchy, `scripts/e2e.sh` OpenSSL end-to-end test, design, profile and CP notes docs.
- Repository scaffold: Go module (standard library only), checks, CI and Dependabot configuration. Supported
  platforms: Linux (tested), macOS (expected to work, untested); Windows through WSL (Git Bash is not supported).
- CI runs ShellCheck (pinned v0.11.0, SHA-256 verified) on `bin/mockpca` and the scripts; `scripts/check.sh` runs it
  when installed.
